# nest.js-tcp_microservice

This is a simple practice **NestJS TCP Microservice** designed to demonstrate the implementation of microservices architecture using TCP transport. The application showcases how to create and manage microservices that communicate over TCP, enabling efficient and scalable inter-service communication. It serves as a foundational project to understand TCP-based microservice integration in a NestJS framework and is built with modularity and scalability in mind.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several services, each with a specific responsibility. Below is the directory structure of the project's main services:

### Core

The `core` directory contains the main application that communicates with the front-end. It acts as the gateway for all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices.

### User

The `user` directory contains the microservice responsible for user registration and login functionalities. It handles user-related operations such as creating new users and authenticating existing users.

### Token

The `token` directory contains the microservice responsible for access token management. It handles the creation, validation, and revocation of access tokens used for securing communication between services.

### Task

The `task` directory contains the microservice responsible for task management. It handles task-related operations.

Each service is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for efficient and maintainable development.

## Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Each service is designed to be independent and modular, promoting separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.
- **TCP Transport**: Utilizes TCP for inter-service communication, ensuring efficient and reliable message delivery.
- **Scalability**: Built with scalability in mind, allowing easy addition of new services and horizontal scaling.
- **User Authentication**: Provides user registration and authentication functionalities.
- **Token Management**: Manages access tokens for secure communication between services.
- **Task Management**: Handles task-related operations.
- **Extensible**: Easily extendable to include additional microservices as needed.
- **NestJS Framework**: Leverages the powerful features of the NestJS framework for building efficient server-side applications.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installation and Setup

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saeedNW/nest.js-tcp_microservice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```shell
   cd nest.js-tcp_microservice
   ```

3. **Install and run each service**:

   To run the services in this project, follow the instructions provided in each service's `README.md` file. For a quick overview, you can follow these steps:

   1. Navigate to each service's directory using a terminal.
   2. Install the required dependencies.

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

   3. Start each service individually.

      ```bash
      npm run start:dev
      ```

   This approach ensures that each service operates independently and as intended.

## Accessing Swagger UI

This application provides interactive API documentation using Swagger.

To access the Swagger UI:

1. Start the core application in development or production mode.
2. Open your web browser and navigate to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000/api-doc
   ```

3. Use the Swagger interface to explore and test the available APIs.
